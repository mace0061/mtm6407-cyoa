Right Hallway

You cautiously proceed down the right corridor, alert for any signs of danger or traps. The air feels heavy with anticipation as you move further away from the desolate chamber. The dim light casts eerie shadows on the walls, heightening your senses and adding an extra layer of mystery to your surroundings.

After what feels like an eternity of walking, you start to hear distant sounds, faint whispers that grow louder with each step. The whispers seem to echo through the stone walls, sending shivers down your spine. Uncertain of what awaits you, you press on, driven by your longing for freedom.

In time, you stumble upon a manuscript that holds the key to your escape. It describes a hidden passage, known only to a select few.

What do you do next?
