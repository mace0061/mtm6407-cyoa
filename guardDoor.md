*Open the door.*

Thankfully the door is unlocked, and without too much effort you're able to push it open. Inside you find a store room with a barrel of water, some more rations, and a few spare guard uniforms. You eat and drink some more, then change into a uniform. The fit isn't perfect, but you're thankful to be wearing something more substantial in the chilly dungeon. Besides, maybe blending in with the guards will come in handy?

You don't have anything for the water, but you take a coarse burlap bag and fill it with the few remaining rations.

Now that you're geared up, it's time to decide where to go next. The hallway seems to lead to light, but what if there was something downstairs that you missed?

What will you do?
