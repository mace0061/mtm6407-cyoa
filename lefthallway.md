*Walk down the left hallway*

You had no energy to climb the stairs, you only could walk along a wall. You thought you heard something from down the walkway to the left, so you decided to go to the left.

"How far had I walked?" After a while, when you began to think that the sound you heard might have been your imagination, you noticed that the path divides here. From the right you smell something delicious, and from the left you hear happy voices. But there are no lights on either side of the path, and it is so dark that you can't see a meter ahead, and a vague sense of unease washes over you. But you can't turn back here, so you decide to take one path.

Suddenly you hear a hair-raising groan from far away on the path you had just taken. You have to make a hasty choice of which way to go, left or right.

Which way will you go?
