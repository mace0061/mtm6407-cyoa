*Climb the stairs*

You still feel week, but you know your only way out of here is to go up. One step at a time you climb the stairs, leaning heavily against the wall. The damp stone leaves your hands cold and clammy.

After what feels like an hour, you finally reach the top. There's another metal-barred door, but it's ajar just as yours was. On the other side you see that you're in some sort of guard station. The guards must come here to change shifts for the cells below. You can hardly believe your eyes: there's a jug of water and some rations lying on a table. You eat them quickly, the bland taste hardly bothering you in your starved state. Now that you have a bit of staying power, you look around. There's a hallway to your left that leads to a lighter area of the dungeon, but there's also a closed wooden door to your right that could hold supplies- or danger.

What will you do?
