Dim light filters through the murk, casting the cold stone in a grey twilight. You awake in your prison cell; four rough walls and a heavy metal barred door are the borders of the world you've lived in for the past few weeks. With little food or water and no protection from the cold, you're barely hanging on. It doesn't matter why you're here, you just want to get out. You hate to admit it, but you know the end must be near. You won't last much longer in this state.

As you rub the sleep from your eyes, hoping to spot a chunk of stale bread or a cup of water in their usual spot by the cel door, something pulls you up short. There's no food or water, but that's not what catches your attention; it's the door, ajar. You think you must be imagining it, or that the gloom is playing tricks on you, but as you approach, dragging your leaden limbs across the damp stone floor, you can see that the door is indeed open. Not enough to notice from a distance, but the gap between the metal door and the latch is unmistakable.

You muster your strength, shove down your exhaustion, and climb to your feet. The metal door is heavy, but you manage to push it open with your shoulder, the hinges creaking ominously. The sound echoes through the empty dungeon as you get your bearings. You're in a wide chamber with prison cells lining the walls- all of them deserted. You're not completely sure, but you think you remember there being other prisoners when you arrived. And the occasional bout of moans or pleading had been a steady beat over the past few weeks, along with the dripping water and clang of metal. Now only the drips can be heard. Whatever happened here, it's left you isolated. For now. There's hallways to your left and right, and a staircase ahead of you.

What do you do?
